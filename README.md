Build and Release Test Work

1. This is a test.
2. Is this way easier to edit the file?


### Can we add in new bullet points when we want?

* Yes we can have something easy to edit online
* exporting the file or copy paste might be more difficult than to just come here and edit the file online.


~~ We can even cancel some text which is old or mistaken ~~

**This text is _extremely_ important**

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
